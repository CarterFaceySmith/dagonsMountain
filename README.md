# dagonsMountain

Dagon's Mountain is a Java-based project built for the primary purpose of reviewing concepts learned in Coding Bootcamp 1 at RMIT.

The game is a retro text-based adventure title, in which you play a hero who must brave the titular mountain in the hopes of reaching the summit to face Dagon himself.

Additional features and concepts will be noted here in the future as the game develops alongside my (currently poor) Java skillset.
